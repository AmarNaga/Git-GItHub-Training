Hello, I am Pragya Humagain. I am currently studying BIM in Hetauda School of Management.


GCA had organized three days training on Git and Github training. Since these both are
completely new terms for me, i had no knowledge about these. But after I joined thses 3 day 
session, i got to learn many things about Git and GitHub. The instructors trained us in a
very clear way. I really appreciate the effort made by GCA.

EXPECTATION:

Since it was three days training regarding Git and Github, i had expected to learn 
Git and Github from beginning i.e. form zero level. And on future days i expect to have
similar trainings.

FEEDBACK

Really appreciated the efforts of instructors, the whole Genese Cloud Academy family,
who taught us, gave us training, helped us increase our knowledge by providing training.
So, no any negative feedback. The workshop went very well. Everything was good. Thankyou :)
