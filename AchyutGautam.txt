Learning Git and Git Hub on these three days was really awesome. It helped me alot to explore the different 
dimensions of Git and Git Hub. We all need Git and Git Hub. So, learning Git and Git Hub was essential for me. 
So, being on these session was really fruitful for me.

On these three days we learned about different aspects of Git and Git Hub. Moreover, we learned about basics of 
Git and Git Hub. Creating repo, creating branches, cloning, forking, commiting, checking the git status, making the 
directory and file,adding remote repositiry, push and pull request were some of the learning on these three days session.
Indeed, we only did not learn the theoretical aspect but also we learned with practical approach.
